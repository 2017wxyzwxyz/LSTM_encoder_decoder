# Building a LSTM Encoder-Deconder using PyTorch to make Sequence-to-Sequence Predictions

## Requirements 
- Python 3 
- PyTorch

## 1 Overview 
There are many instances where we want to predict how a time series will behave in the future. For example, given the number of times a web page was visited in the past, we may want to predict how many many times the page will be viewed in the future.
