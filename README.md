# Building a LSTM Encoder-Deconder using PyTorch to make Sequence-to-Sequence Predictions

## Requirements 
- Python 3 
- PyTorch

## 1 Overview 
There are many instances where we want to predict how a time series will behave in the future. For example, given the number of times a web page was visited in the past, we may want to predict how many views the page will get in the future.

 <em> <font size = "4"> Web page traffic is a typical time series prediction problem. For example, given past information on the number of views of Stephen Hawking's Wikipedia page, we may want to predict how many times we expect this page to be viewed in the future.  </font> </em>
