# Building a LSTM Encoder-Deconder using PyTorch to make Sequence-to-Sequence Predictions

## Requirements 
- Python 3 
- PyTorch

## 1 Overview 
There are many instances where we want to predict how a time series will behave in the future. For example, given

 <em> <font size = "4"> Zonal flows occur in Jupiter's deep atmosphere and dynamo region (i.e., where the magnetic
 field is <br> generated). These flows are associated with density perturbations that alter the planet's gravity field.</font> </em>
